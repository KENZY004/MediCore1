# 🏥 ZenoCare — Multi-Tenant Hospital Operations Platform  

ZenoCare is a full-stack SaaS-based hospital management platform that allows multiple hospitals to operate independently on a shared system. Each hospital functions as an isolated tenant with secure role-based access and a complete patient lifecycle workflow.

The project focuses on multi-tenant architecture, strict data isolation, JWT authentication, and real-world hospital operations management.
